# Assignment A — UPI Payment Flow with SMS Confirmation

## Overview

This project is part of the **VibeCode Intern assignment**.
It demonstrates a simple **UPI payment flow** with a simulated SMS-based payment confirmation.

---

## Features

* Displays an **order summary** (item, price, order ID).
* **Pay via UPI** button that opens your mobile UPI app (Google Pay, PhonePe, etc.) with pre-filled payment details.
* **Simulated SMS confirmation** updates the payment status automatically after a few seconds.

> Note: Real SMS reading is not implemented for security reasons. This simulation demonstrates the workflow and satisfies the bonus requirement.
